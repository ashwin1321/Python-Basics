# Abstraction :  --> abstraction is the process of separating ideas from specific instances of those ideas at work
              #  --> Break into fragments (eg:to make a game we create different class for player, city, etc and merge together )


# Encapsulation : --> encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components
                # --> Hide the details of implementation
